## Introduction
1. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Handling Class Imbalances and Overfitting/Underfitting
3. Data Augmentation and Rectification
4. Model Evaluation and Visualization
5. Practical Applications


## General Information

This code implements a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images into one of nine categories.
The model is trained on a dataset of images, with the goal of learning features that can accurately predict the class label of new, unseen images.


## Technologies Used
TensorFlow
numpy
Augmentor
Matplotlib
ImageDataGenerator
Keras

## Training and validation

The model is trained on the augmented dataset for 20 epochs, with validation on the separate test dataset. The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Conclusions
The final model is trained on the rectified class imbalance data for 30 epochs, with validation on the separate test dataset. The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance.
